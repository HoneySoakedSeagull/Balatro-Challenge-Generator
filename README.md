# Balatro-Challenge-Generator
A python scripted lua generator for making Balatro Challenge Deck Mods.

Launch the python script with your preffered method, choose your desired options, when happy click save to lua file and navigate to your mods folder, create a new folder and save the lua inside of it. You now should have a new challenge called General Challenge under challenges in Balatro.

For now only jokers, cards, vouchers and consumables can be edited. There are plans for more customisers such as deck name, author, game conditions, banned cards etc.

Should you wish to make this work with modded options, simply add to the relevant map in order to impliment it as an option in the dropdown.

Compatability with other challenges hasn't really been tested. Any issues with them or in general though feel free to hit me up on discord and I can try what I can but I am in no means a decent coder.
